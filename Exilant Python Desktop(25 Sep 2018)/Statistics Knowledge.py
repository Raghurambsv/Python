scatter plot is best used for linear progression (means where there is a something constant in the data values)
Ex: price/sqft ratio is same for all datapoints
    (if there no constant ratio than it will deviate from the LINEAR LINE...thats called Noise..Liner can be +ve or -ve too)
    
Bar graph: Is better used to plot a cumulative values (it plots 2D data)   

Histogram: (Plots 1D data) its like Age in x-axis  and y-Axis(is simply how many belong to that age group plotted or frequency of age)

Pie-Chart: is best used for relative data (like how much percent each team scored in poltics)

Variance = sum of all squares (mean - indivual_items) / No of items 
[ If the variance value is small it tells the data values in the set are almost close to each other]
[If the variance is large it tells that the data values have extreme (low/high)values present in set]
standard devition = squareroot of Variance
